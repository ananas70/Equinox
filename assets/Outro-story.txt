The Frog bravely rescued Diana from the dragon’s cave.
When they arrived at the gates of the kingdom, Diana turned to him and gently asked,
“Please, take off your mask — I want to see your true face.”
Ashamed, the Frog hesitated. “I cannot,” he said. 
“I carry a hideous flaw.”
But Diana insisted, saying, “What matters to me is your soul,
not your appearance.”

With sorrow in his heart, the Frog slowly removed his mask.
To his surprise, he found not fear or disgust in Diana’s eyes — but love.
She confessed her feelings to him,
for his courage, his kindness, and everything good he had shown her.

A few months later, Diana and the Frog were wed in a joyous celebration,
surrounded by the cheers of their people.

And so, the kingdom of Glodenor found happiness once more,
and its people lived in peace and love for the rest of their days.
