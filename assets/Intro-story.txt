SCENA 1 - Glodenor și Prințesa Diana

(glodenor-intro)Once upon a time, in a kingdom where peace and love bloomed in every corner, in a world where nature and joy lived hand in hand, there ruled a beautiful and kind-hearted princess. Her name was Princess Diana.
She had ruled over the kingdom of Glodenor since the young age of seventeen, and her reign was known as the most just and prosperous in memory. Even as a child, Diana carried a deep passion for justice and fairness.
The people often called her 'The Lawful Diana.' She was beloved by villagers, animals, children, and even nature itself, for her pure heart and unwavering principles.

Yet beyond the borders of Glodenor, in the enchanted lands surrounding the kingdom, the seasons themselves were in a constant dance, shifting and changing in ways that no one fully understood.

But, as all of you may know, there is no light without shadow, no generosity without envy.
The happiness and prosperity of Glodenor were about to be disturbed by a solitary, wicked dragon named Yryneus Malus.
Far away — three days and three nights of journeying from the kingdom — Yryneus lived alone in a cavern, guarding his enormous treasure of countless gold and precious gems.
Yet, no matter how vast his fortune grew, it could never fill the emptiness in his heart. Yryneus was miserable and achingly lonely.

One day, a wandering letter, carried by the winds of fate, found its way into Yryneus’ lonely cave.
It was an invitation to Princess Diana’s grand twenty-second birthday celebration, welcoming all living creatures from Glodenor and the neighboring lands.
Within the letter was also a magnificent portrait of Diana herself.
The moment Yryneus laid his eyes upon her, his cold heart stirred with a feeling he had never known — love.
Determined to win her heart, he vowed to do whatever it would take.
And so, after five long centuries of solitude, Yryneus left his hoarded gold behind and set out on a journey to Glodenor, to ask for Princess Diana’s hand in marriage.

Yryneus traveled three days and three nights until he reached the gates of Glodenor.
He arrived just in time for Princess Diana’s grand birthday celebration.
Under the starlit skies, with the whole kingdom gathered in joy, Yryneus presented himself before the princess, bowing low and offering treasures beyond imagination.
He asked for her hand in marriage, his voice trembling with hope.
But Princess Diana, with the same kindness and wisdom that made her beloved by all, gently refused.
'Great Yryneus,' she said, 'when I was but a child, I made a promise to myself and to my people: that I would give my heart only for true, selfless love, not for gold, nor for gifts, nor for fear.
Forgive me, but I cannot be yours.'
Her words were soft, yet they struck Yryneus deeper than any sword could.
Blinded by sorrow and rage, Yryneus let out a roar that shook the very walls of the castle.
Without warning, he seized Princess Diana in his mighty claws and soared into the night sky.
The people of Glodenor watched in horror as the dragon disappeared beyond the mountains.
Yryneus carried Diana back to his dark cavern and swore,
'Since you deny me, you shall stay here for all eternity, a prisoner of your own choice.'

SCENA 5 - Viața Broscoiului
Long before Princess Diana’s capture, there lived a man who, when he was just a boy, had saved a bat from the wicked clutches of a cruel witch.
Angered by his act of bravery, the witch punished him severely. She disfigured his face, and as a constant reminder of his defiance, she cursed him to wear a mask shaped like a frog.
From that day forward, he became known as the Frog, though beneath the mask, he remained a man, his heart as pure and courageous as ever.

The frog lived as a humble lumberjack in the woods of Glodenor. But when he heard of Princess Diana's capture by the evil dragon, a fire ignited within him.
He could not stand idly by. With a heart full of resolve, he sold all his belongings, gathering money and weapons for the dangerous journey ahead.
And so, with no time to spare, the frog embarked on his noble quest, his heart resolute, driven by a fierce determination to free Princess Diana from the dragon’s merciless claws and restore her to the safety she so dearly deserved.


To rescue Princess Diana, the frog had to cross through the four seasons of the enchanted lands. Each season held its own trials, testing his courage, heart, and determination. Spring would challenge his resolve, summer his strength, autumn his wisdom, and winter, his very will to continue.
